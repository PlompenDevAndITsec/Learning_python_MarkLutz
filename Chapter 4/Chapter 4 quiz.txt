Chapter 4 quiz:
--------------------------------------------------------

1. Name four of python's core data types.

	-char
	-string
	-bool
	-int
	-double
	-float

Answer (in short):

Numbers, strings, lists, dictionaries are core (object) data types.
Bool's can be considered as data types as well none too.
Number types such as floats, integers etc).


2. Why are they called core data types.

	because they come with the core data package of python and don't require any imports.

Answer:

My answer was basically correct won't defer more.


3. What does "immutable" mean? And which core python types are considered immutable?

	Immutable means that they cannot be changed after creation.

	-Strings
	-Tuples
	-Comprehensions? not sure

Answer:

The third one was numbers.
	

4. What does "sequence" mean, and which three types fall into that catagory?

	Must have glossed over this part.

	It's definition is basically one after the other so that.

Answer:


A sequence is a positionally ordered collection of objects. strings, lists, and tuples are all sequences in python.



5. What does "mapping" mean, and which core type is mapping.

	Peaked at the answer but mapping means an object that denjotes an object that maps keys to associated values.

Answer:

I peaked so my answer is same as the answer but my intitial guess of dictonairy's was correct.



6. What does "polymorphism," and why should you care?


	polymorphism means the transformation of something. In something as stale as a computer it can be nice to have something that can change.
	that's why you should care.


Answer:

You basically don't constrain something to a specefic type.
